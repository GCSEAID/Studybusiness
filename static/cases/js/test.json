Guittard Chocolate Company is a leading manufacturer of chocolate for the confectionary, baking, and ice cream industries. The company has been family-owned for four generations and is the oldest independent chocolate company in the United States. (The Ghirardelli family sold their famous Bay Area chocolate company in 1960.) The company is one of only ten in the United States making chocolate from cacao beans. Most of the company's output consists of ten-pound blocks of several varieties of chocolate, as well as other confections, which are then resold by retail confectioners. The company produces a range of branded confectionary products, most notably its Smooth & Melty mints. The company's strongest sales areas are in the Midwest and the West. Company president Gary Guittard has attributed the company's longevity, as well as its ability to survive as an independent player in spite of widespread industry consolidation, to a unique balance of flexibility and consistency. As he told Newsday, We always say, 'Taste has memory.' The company prides itself on being quick to respond to the marketplace. However, some of Guittard's recipes, such as for Old Dutch milk chocolate, date back more than 100 years. The corporate headquarters is known for the potted cacao tree in its lobby.",
