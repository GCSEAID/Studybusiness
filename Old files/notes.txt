Basically the extends feature in django allows me to create a single file in html and call it base.html for example then I could add EVERY SINGLE HTML ELEMENT that I am
going to use in my website in that file and make a block for that using `block (block_name)`. A block is simply a chunk of html code.

This simply allows me to define parts of code in 1 place then reference it to Bulma css then just use that everywhere else in my code without rewriting it.

For example:
    - Lets say on the home page I am going to use a couple of sections which will have some content in there, I dont need to define the content inside them in the
    base.html file, I just define the sections and whatever styles/classes they are gonna have. Then, I just call them in a separate home.html file and just add my
    content to them like `{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block sections } {% block sections_content_area %} <h1>hello world</h1> {% endblock sections_content_area%}
    {% endblock sections%}`
